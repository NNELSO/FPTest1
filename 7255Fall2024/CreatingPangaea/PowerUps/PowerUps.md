* I had power ups working in the game before adding in the 
weapons afterwards it broke the game so I commented most of it out. <br>
* I have a 2nd project that I am attempting to get it to work in, but I was a 
lot more focused on making the power material and components.<br>
* I plan on continuing this part of the project over the break and 
adding more it here and the videos to my wix page.<br>
