<br>

* First thing that was covered was setting up a "New C++ Class". <br>
* C++ Classes allow you to create a new base that is tailored to your exact need that can be used then in blueprints.<br>
* The 1st new c++ class I created in Pangaea was a defense tower.
    * right-click in the Pangaea C++ folder and choose New C++ Class
    * Next choose Actor under the common classes, select next.
    * Leave the Public and Private buttons unselected
    * Name field type: DefenseTower
    * Spelling is important, if you misspell something in this step you are stuck with it.
    * Hit create.
        * You should now be able to find your new class in the Pangaea C++ Folder,
          if you don't save and quit and reload the game. This is where I had difficulties
          as I often forgot to check.

<br>

* When coding we always start with the header file. It will contain the "name of your file" followed by ".h" <br>
* 1st thing that should always be added to this file is "#pragma once", it helps the compiler not freakout if there are redundancies.<br>
* Here you can take a look at the code I used for the header file:

> [DefenseTower.h(CreatingPangaea/CodeFiles/DefenseTower.h)]
